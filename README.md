# kicad-tinbox

## Introduction

This plugin is designed to create a PCB outline tailored for rounded tin boxes,
such as those used for mint candies. It simplifies the design process by 
automatically calculating the rounded corners based on a few easily measurable
parameters.

Additionally, the plugin offers the option to add four mounting holes
positioned at the corners of the PCB. Users can specify the diameter of mounting
holes required or set the value to 0 if no mounting holes are needed.
